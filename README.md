## [Understanding language - one evaluation at a time](https://github.com/Maaarcocr/papers-i-wrote/blob/master/understanding-language-one.pdf)
In this survey I will firstly introduce the reader to the basic concepts that power the modern NLP research, describing concepts like neural networks, optimizations techniques and word embeddings. Then, I will describe the status of the art of evaluation in the NLP community, what problems exist and solutions. I will conclude exploring by future directions in evaluating NLP systems.
